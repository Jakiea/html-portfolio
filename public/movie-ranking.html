<h1> Top Movies of All Time According to Jakiea</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Word War Z</h3>
<p>This film is very action packed, it contains zombies. The story plot is really good and it keeps you on the edge of the seat. Highly reccommend </p>
<h3>Train to Busan</h3>
<p>This is another zombie film I absoutly love. This takes place in a train where they are trapped with people who are turning into zombies. They need to survive until they get rescued.</p>
<h3>Prince of Egypt</h3>
<p>I love this film, this film is amazing; it has a spritual meaning behind this film and I really do connect with this film and see the higher being (God) talking to Moses and how he should save his people from the awful prince. He made the people into his personal slaves and he treats them however he pleases.</p>
